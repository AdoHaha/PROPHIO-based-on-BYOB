PROPHIO based on BYOB
===========
This is the Prophio source package README file.

Prophio (Programming of Physical Objects) is a modification of BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks), a programming language for beginners. It allows controlling and programming a M-System robot via Bluetooth. 

Prophio is written in Squeak, and depends on a Squeak virtual machine. For more information about squeak, see: http://www.squeak.org/. 

Prophio is based on (BYOB) by Jens Moenig and Brian Harvey, which is in turn based on Scratch 1.4 from MIT Media Labs, so most of guides applicable to Scratch and BYOB will apply to Prophio as well. 

The Squeak source code for Prophio ( PROPHIO.image ) is set to open in "User Mode" by default. If you'd like to enter "Dev" mode to make changes to the source code, you can do so by following these steps: 

Name your virtual machine file PROPHIO.exe and move it to the same directory as prophio.image and prophio.changes.
Run PROPHIO Developement.bat and follow these steps:

1. Shift-click the Edit menu.
2. Click "Turn fill screen off".
3. Click the white area that appears at the right and bottom of the window.
4. Click open....
5. Click browser
6. The System Browser appears â€” this is where you can edit the code.

Since Prophio runs as an image on a Squeak virtual machine, all that needs to be compiled when packaging Prophio are the necessary plugins, which can be done  on Linux using the included makefile. The following libraries are necessary to build the plugins:
libcairo2-dev (>= 1.8.6), libpango1.0-dev (>= 1.20.5), libglib2.0-dev (>= 2.20.1)

Note: the Camera plug-in will make use of libv4l2 (>= 0.5.8) at run-time if found.

On Windows, you can use plugins from binary distribution of Prohio or Scratch 1.4.
